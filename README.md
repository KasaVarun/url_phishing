## Introduction

Phishing is a cybercrime that involves tricking users into revealing sensitive information such as passwords and credit card details. This project aims to detect such phishing URLs by using machine learning algorithms. The repository provides code for preprocessing, training, and evaluating the model.

## Features

- Data preprocessing to extract relevant features from URLs.
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for classification.
- Evaluation of the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/KasaVarun/url_phishing.git
cd url_phishing

2. Reruirments
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

To classify URLs, you can use the provided scripts. For example:

python predict.py https://example.com

## Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation can be found in the dataset directory. It contains labeled examples of phishing and non-phishing URLs.

## Model Training
To train the phishing detection model, use the provided scripts. For instance:

python train.py

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using various metrics and displayed in the terminal.
